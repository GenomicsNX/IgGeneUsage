```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Introduction

The IgGeneUsage package comes with a few gene usage datasets taken from the 
following publications:
    * D1: XXX
    * D2: XXX
In this tutorial we explore the different functionalities of the R package using
these datasets.



## Case Study
### D1: XXX

```{r cars}
data(IGHV_HCV)
```


### D2: XXX

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
